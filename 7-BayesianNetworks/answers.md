### Exercise 1

A) P(A | B, C) = P(A, B, C) / P(B, C) = P(A, B | C) * P(C) / P(B, C)
			   = P(A | C) * P(B | C) * P(C) / P(B, C)
			   = P(A | C) * P(B | C) * P(C) / (P(B | C) * P(C))
			   = P(A | C)
CQFD.

B) P(A, B | C) = P(A, B, C) / P(C) = P(A | B, C) * P(B, C) / P(C)
			   = P(A | B, C) * P(B | C)
			   = P(A | C) * P(B | C)
CQFD.

Proofs using 2 in 1 and 1 in 2. Is that even legal ?

#### Exercise 2

(I am not using anything from the course, weird as fuck)

A) P(S = t) = 0.1 ; P(S = f) = 0.9

B) P(C | S = t) = 0.25 ; P(C, S) = P(S) * P(C | S) = 0.1 * 0.25 = 0.025

C) P(S) P(-Cb | S) P(Cl | S)
